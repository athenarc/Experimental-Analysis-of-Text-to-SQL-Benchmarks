# Analysis of Text-to-SQL Benchmarks: Limitations, Challenges and Opportunities

Despite being a fast-paced research field, text-to-SQL systems face critical challenges. The datasets used for the training and evaluation of these systems play a vital role in determining their performance as well as  the progress in the field. In this work, we introduce a methodology for text-to-SQL dataset analysis, and we perform an in-depth analysis of several text-to-SQL datasets, providing valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations and how they affect training and evaluation of text-to-SQL systems.  We investigate existing evaluation methods, and propose a more informative system evaluation based on error analysis. Using this evaluation methodology, we delve into the performance of well-known systems, showing new insights as well as the potential of our approach.
